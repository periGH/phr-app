# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### MongoDB Connection Setup ### 
- This application uses MongoDB for data storage, leveraging MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution. To connect the application backend to MongoDB, follow these steps:

- Create a MongoDB Atlas Account: Sign up for MongoDB Atlas at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and create a cluster. For development purposes, the free tier (M0) cluster is sufficient.

- Configure Database Access: In the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, navigate to the "Database Access" section to add a new database user with read and write privileges.

- Whitelist Your IP Address: For security, MongoDB Atlas requires you to whitelist IP addresses that can access your database. You can add your current IP address or allow access from anywhere for development purposes in the "Network Access" section.

- Connect Your Application: Go to your cluster's "Connect" section, select "Connect your application," and copy the provided connection string.

- Environment Variable: Store the connection string in an environment variable named MONGO_URI in a .env file at the root of your project. Replace <password> with the password of the database user you created, and <dbname> with the name of your database. It should look something like this:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://yourUser:yourPassword@yourClusterURL/yourDBname

- Server Configuration: Ensure your backend server uses mongoose or a similar MongoDB driver to connect to the database using the MONGO_URI environment variable. You may need to install necessary packages (e.g., npm install mongoose dotenv).

- Start Your Server: Run your server (e.g., with npm run server). If everything is configured correctly, you should see a "Connected to MongoDB" message in your server logs, indicating a successful connection.
